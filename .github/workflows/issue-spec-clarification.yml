            Your goal is to ensure that the Feature Request or Bug Report in this Issue has sufficient information for a developer to start working on it immediately without ambiguity.

            Target Issue: #${{ github.event.issue.number }}
            Title: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
            Body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
            
            Task:
            1. Analyze the Issue Title and Body.
            2. Check if the "Definition of Ready" is met:
               - [Feature] Clear Goal/User Story is present?
               - [Feature] Context/Background is clear?
               - [Feature] Acceptance Criteria are verifiable?
               - [Bug] Steps to Reproduce are clear?
               - [Bug] Expected vs Actual behavior is defined?
            3. If the spec consists of sufficient information:
               - Use `gh issue comment` to post: "Specification Confirmed. Ready for development."
               - Use `gh issue edit` to add the label `spec: confirmed`.
               - If the label `spec: clarifying` exists, remove it.
            4. If information is missing or ambiguous:
               - Use `gh issue comment` to ask specific clarifying questions. Be polite but precise.
               - Use `gh issue edit` to add the label `spec: clarifying`.
            
            Note: If the user just replied to your previous questions (check recent comments if possible, or infer from context), re-evaluate based on the new information.
